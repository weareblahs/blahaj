# BLÅHAJ?
*You won't make sure if the legendary shark toy is in stock in your local IKEA warehouse*

## Why not do this in `scripts4fun`?
I think this project needs to have its dedicated GitHub page, so I made this up.

## What's this all about?
A simplified page to check the stock of BLÅHAJ soft toy as it's **always** out of stock in Malaysia. There's also a 55cm variation of BLÅHAJ but now it's out of stock.  
Dedicated to the beloved shark toy on IKEA.

## How does this work?
This webpage contacts the JSON API of IKEA Malaysia to get the stock information for each IKEA store in Malaysia (Batu Kawan, Cheras, Damansara and Tebrau). Updates when you refresh - this page won't update every hour like *covidcases*.

## Where's the page?
