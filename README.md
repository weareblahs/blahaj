# ikeatoys
*I organized all IKEA toys into a website so you don't have to*

## Why not do this in `scripts4fun`?
I think this project needs to have its dedicated GitHub page, so I made this up.

## How does it work?
This webpage contacts the JSON API of IKEA Malaysia to get the stock information for each IKEA store in Malaysia (Batu Kawan, Cheras, Damansara and Tebrau). Check the [Scripts folder](https://github.com/weareblahs/ikeatoys/tree/main/scripts) to see how it works through code - I've written some comments on what the parts does.

Do note that this website refreshes the newest data from the IKEA website when it loads.

## What's this all about?
A simplified page to check the stock of BLÅHAJ soft toy as it's **always** out of stock in Malaysia. There's also a 55cm variation of BLÅHAJ but now it's out of stock.  
Dedicated to the beloved shark toy on IKEA.
